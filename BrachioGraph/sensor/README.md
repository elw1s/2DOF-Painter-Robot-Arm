Great choice! The MPU6050 is a popular sensor for measuring acceleration and gyroscope data. To read values from it using a Raspberry Pi Zero in C++, you'll likely need a library to interface with the sensor. One commonly used library for this purpose is the "i2cdevlib" library, specifically the MPU6050 library within it.

Here's a basic guide on how you might approach this:

### Setting Up:

1. **Connect the sensor to the Raspberry Pi Zero** using the I2C pins (SDA and SCL) and ensure the Pi recognizes the sensor.

2. **Install the necessary libraries** on your Raspberry Pi Zero. You might need to install `i2c-tools` and enable I2C in the Pi's configuration. Also, you'll need to install the `libi2c-dev` package for development.

### Code Implementation:

Assuming you have the `i2cdevlib` installed and the sensor connected properly, here's an example of how you might use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <cstdint>
#include "MPU6050.h"

MPU6050 mpu;

int main() {
    // Initialize the sensor
    int16_t ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz;
    mpu.initialize();

    // Verify connection to the sensor
    std::cout << "Testing MPU6050 connections...\n";
    if (mpu.testConnection()) {
        std::cout << "MPU6050 connection successful\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "MPU6050 connection failed\n";
        return 1;
    }

    while (true) {
        // Read accelerometer and gyroscope values
        mpu.getMotion6(&ax, &ay, &az, &gx, &gy, &gz);

        // Print values
        std::cout << "Accelerometer:\n";
        std::cout << " X: " << ax << " Y: " << ay << " Z: " << az << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Gyroscope:\n";
        std::cout << " X: " << gx << " Y: " << gy << " Z: " << gz << std::endl;

        // Delay between readings
        usleep(100000); // Sleep for 100 milliseconds (adjust as needed)
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation:

To compile this code, assuming you've saved it in a file named `mpu6050_example.cpp`, you can use:

```bash
g++ -o mpu6050_example mpu6050_example.cpp MPU6050.cpp -I.
```

Replace `MPU6050.cpp` with the correct path to the `MPU6050` library file if it's located elsewhere. This command compiles your code and links it with the required library.

### Running the Code:

After compiling successfully, you can run the executable `mpu6050_example`:

```bash
./mpu6050_example
```

Remember, this is a basic example. You might need to handle errors, calibrate the sensor, or implement more complex functionality based on your project's requirements.

Always refer to the sensor's datasheet and the library documentation for detailed information on how to properly use the sensor and its library functions.
